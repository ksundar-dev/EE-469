# Compile Verilog
#     We can include all SystemVerilog files in the current folder using the
#     following line:
vlog "./*.sv"
#     This uses the asterisk (*) to match all files ending in ".sv" at once.
#     NOTE: If you have incomplete files in the current folder, they will be
#     picked up, and will probably fail to compile. Delete any old/unused
#     files, or include only the specific files you need.

# Call vsim to invoke simulator
#     Make sure the last item on the line is the name of the testbench module
#     you want to execute.
